/**
 * @brief Class to read a PDA from a file. The file must have the following format (comments with a '#' starting the line will be ignored):
 * 
 *        - The first line contains the states of the PDA separated by spaces.
 * 
 *        - The second line contains the input alphabet of the PDA separated by spaces.
 * 
 *        - The third line contains the stack alphabet of the PDA separated by spaces.
 * 
 *        - The fourth line contains the initial state of the PDA.
 * 
 *        - The fifth line contains the initial stack symbol of the PDA.
 * 
 *        - The rest of the lines contain the transitions of the PDA in the format: "fromState inputSymbol stackTop toState stackSymbols"
 * 
 *        - To represent the empty symbol use the '.' character.
